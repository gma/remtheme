System requirements
-------------------

Perl (I have 5.004_04 - I've not tried it with earlier versions)
Window Maker (obviously)

Installation
------------

I'd recommend you install remtheme by typing (as root);

  % cp remtheme /usr/local/bin

but it doesn't matter where you put it really. Just make sure that the first
line of the script points to the location of your perl interpreter.

Read the docs in the script itself with Perl's perldoc utility;

  % perldoc remtheme

You can convert them into a proper manpage (if you prefer) by doing something
like;

  % pod2man ./remtheme > /usr/local/man/man1/remtheme.1
